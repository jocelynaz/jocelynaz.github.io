 	<h1> <big>An increase in residency petitions due to domestic violence.</big></h1>
<h2><medium>The Center for Immigration Studies documented that more than 10,000 applications for VAWA (Violence Against Women Act) petions were recieved in 2018.</medium></h2>

<h3> By Jocelyn Azucena Contreras</h3>

<p1> The U.S. has made it more difficult for migrant women to receive asylum when they face imminent danger in their home country. In 2018, the U.S. Department of Justice denied asylum to a Salvadoran woman who alleged her husband had abused her. The qualifications for asylum seekers consisted of the fear of persecution: religious, national, racial, political and identity politics.<br>
<br>However, domestic violence or any other form of individual violence had been ruled out by former Attorney Jeff Sessions. <br><br>
Homeland Security’s website lists criteria for a potential case for victims. For victims with a connection to an American family member must “have good moral character;” victims with or without visa status must be “victims of qualifying criminal activity,” like murder or rape and “process credible and reliable information”; and for victims of human trafficking, they must be present in the US during their dilemma and must be a “victim of a severe form of trafficking.”

<p1> "Domestic violence has not gone down. It's true across the world," said Margarita Guzmán, Executive Director for New York's Violence Intervention Program (VIP Mujeres). VIP Mujeres is an organization focused on helping Latina, mostly migrant, victims of domestic violence across NYC. <br><br>

The gap in VAWA petitions in 2015 to 2018 is wide. From 2,224 documented petitions to 12,597 in just 3 years, the process is limited. <br> <br> Processing applications can last up to 16 months; while the approval or denial can range from 6 to 24 months before a woman is notified if she is safe or not.  </p1>  <br><br>  <br><br>

Downloaded from 2009 to 2018 but used seven year data. I had to manually incput the pdf into the excel sheets to compare all data from each year.

Here is a link to a clean insert pivot table that I created:

Let me know if you can see!
